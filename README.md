# AHAS BASH-Risk
Uses Weather and NEXRAD data to predict USAHAS.com Bird and Aircraft Strike Risk
This repository contains examples of the scripts used for the Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University PhD dissertation in aviation, "Prediction of Bird and Aircraft Strike Risk using Weather Data and Machine Learning," by Jason Powell, August 2025.
The script contains the Anaconda Jupyter code for imputation and the COLAB script for the LSTM-RNN, XGBoost, KNN transformations, and the CGBN. The features can be adjusted, but there are downstream issues with feature permutation, CI, and ensembling that require matching features. Two examples of the entire script, which contain different feature lists with an ensemble, are included in the repository.
