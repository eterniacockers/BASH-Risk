# AHAS BASH-Risk
Uses Weather and NEXRAD data to predict USAHAS.com Bird and Aircraft Strike Risk
This repository contains examples of the scripts used for the Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University PhD dissertation in aviation, "Prediction of Bird and Aircraft Strike Risk using Weather Data and Machine Learning," by Jason Powell, August 2025. Pay close attention to the description for each script, as the features and file names change throughout the script to match the initial objectives of the code. Most of the script remains unchanged, but the requirements to match feature lists or file sizes do change throughout the overall code.
The script contains the Anaconda Jupyter code for imputation and the COLAB script for the LSTM-RNN, XGBoost, KNN transformations, and the CGBN. The features can be adjusted, but there are downstream issues with feature permutation, CI, and ensembling that require matching features to address. Two examples of the entire script, which contain different feature lists with an ensemble, are included in the repository. 
The AHP Analysis was also included. The AHP developed a weather feature list based on the expert opinion of USDA Wildlife Hazard Biologists. The list was then compared to the ML feature priority list.
